Project description:
___________
Welcome to my next project. This is quite commonly known as the "To Do List". The project is not responsive, it renders correctly only in desktop versions - I made it to understand some arrays functions well.

You can try it here: https://noxagen.github.io/to-do-project/

Description and features:
_______________

Welcome in my another project, this time i worked about desktop aplication and focus about javascript improve, especialy i need to learn more
about arrays methods, that's why i choose this kind of aplication. The project is 100% in Polish language.

1. You can add a task with a maximum of 31 characters, if it is longer or empty - the checking function will not allow you to transfer the task to the board. If you typed everything correctly, after pressing the key your sentence will go to the appropriate array, the class and two buttons for handling will be added to it.

2. If you manage to complete a task from the list and press the check-button, you will no longer be able to remove a task from the list, its color will be changed to green and the description will be crossed out.

3. If you want to delete an incomplete task, press the red button, then the task will be removed from the Array and the remaining tasks will get a new index with a key, which will allow the statistics to be correctly rendered on the right side.

4. On the left side there is a field in which we will see a hint every time we start entering a task in the input area. The example shows how I enter a phrase and the table automatically suggests tasks with similar letters.

5. One more feature regarding the hint table, if you press the plus button, the selected task will be moved to the main board, the button will be disabled and the task will not be able to be added again. I opted for such a solution instead of checking for duplicates.

Summary:
_______________
I consider the project complete, it taught me some very interesting array functions, and for the first time I had backwardness with passing two arguments in a function while indexing and assigning the 'key' attribute. I use the list myself for everyday work :)
