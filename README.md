Description:

Welcome in my another project, this time i worked about desktop aplication and focus about javascript improve, especialy i need to learn more
about arrays methods, that's why i choose this kind of aplication. 

1. You can add whatever task you want into to-do list.
2. When tour task is done, by clicking on check-button it will change color and be immune to remove.
3. When you remove task it's completly disapear from the list and from the array, also index of tasks will upgrade.
4. Program will check if there is empty-imput or too-long, alert will show up.
5. I add some common tasks in hints-section and also inject there filter function, so when user start typing task, hint-section will try to found similiar task.
6. You can also add task from hint-section by clicking plus button, after user add desired task, 'add button' will become disabled (I used this method for anty-duplicates).
7. There is also summary-section on the right side, wich counts how many tasks left, how many dones etc.
